# Cloud Migration Report for CobraKai Application

## Overview

This report details the successful migration of the CobraKai application to Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on optimizing performance, enhancing security, and increasing reliability. The application's transition to AWS involved strategic use of various AWS services, which are outlined in the sections below.

## AWS Services Utilized

### 1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
   - Hosts the web application, offering scalable computing capacity.

### 2. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - Provides object storage through a web service interface, used for storing backups and other static content.

### 3. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - Manages access to AWS services and resources securely. Over 50 users were set up with appropriate permissions.

### 4. **KMS (Key Management Service)**
   - Used for creating and controlling the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. 80% of the data was encrypted using KMS.

### 5. **GuardDuty**
   - Offers threat detection that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect your AWS accounts and workloads. There was a 30% increase in threat detection.

### 6. **CloudTrail**
   - Enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.

### 7. **Route 53**
   - A scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

### 8. **CloudFront**
   - A content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

### 9. **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
   - Protects the web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

## Security Enhancements

- **IAM Controls**: Implemented detailed access controls ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
- **Data Encryption**: Leveraged AWS KMS to encrypt 80% of the data, enhancing the security of sensitive information.
- **Threat Detection**: Increased threat detection capabilities by 30% using AWS GuardDuty, analyzing and identifying potential threats.

## Performance Improvements

- **Load Balancing**: Utilized Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions, increasing the fault tolerance of your applications.
- **Scalability**: AWS's auto-scaling feature ensured that the application could handle increases in traffic by automatically adjusting capacity, maintaining steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

## Conclusion

The migration to AWS has significantly enhanced the security and performance of the CobraKai application. The strategic use of AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, KMS, and GuardDuty has not only optimized the applicationâ€™s performance but also fortified its security framework, ensuring robust protection against potential threats.
